These endpoints are used for the integration. Be sure to hit
settings -> security -> remote site settings on Salesforce and
add our domain for these to be available in all places.

## USER INTERACTIVE ENDPOINTS ##

These will prompt the user to log in if required and are meant to be used
by a user in a browser pop-up window, not by API. They can also be accessed
manually for testing, but the design is optimized for a popup created from
Salesforce and it may attempt to automatically close the window with javascript
when completing its task; it assumes the parent window is temporary.

Pulls the BZ user info page:

/admin/users/find_by_salesforce_id/{!Item.Id}


Pulls the enroll confirmation page

/admin/users/enroll_by_salesforce_id/{!Item.Id}

## API ENDPOINTS ##

These are meant to be used from APEX api and require a magic token to be
present for the request to be processed. The magic token takes the place
of a login requirement, but is not considered especially secure - it
is more to prevent random web crawlers from firing off activity than
to be real security.

The magic token is a url param named magic_token.

API endpoints are found in the SalesforceController. We currently have

change_apply_now - takes a yes_list and a no_list which is a comma-separated list
of Lead IDs
