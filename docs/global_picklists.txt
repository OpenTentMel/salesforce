# These are picklist values that can be shared by multiple picklist
# fields.  Note: at the time of writing the only way to change an 
# existing picklist field to use a global picklist for it's values is
# to delete it and recreate it.  Too much trouble for now, so we still
# have some shared lists duplicated in each field.
