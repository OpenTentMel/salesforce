Settings our code expects. Remember, the API name used in the code will
be these names with a __c appended at the end.

The instance name is 'bz'.

class BZ_Settings {
	/// The base url used to communicate with the join.bebraven.org site.
	/// It should contain protocol and domain, but no ending slash.
	///
	/// Remember, this is join.bebraven.org, NOT canvas.
	///
	/// For example, https://stagingjoin.bebraven.org
	/// or https://join.bebraven.org
	String base_url;

	/// The magic token is a random alphanumeric string that serves
	/// like a password between Salesforce and our server. It isn't
	/// true security, it can be intercepted by man-in-the-middle
	/// attacks and may be stored in server logs, but it should keep
	/// casual and accidental URL scrapers from setting off our processes.
	///
	/// It must match on the Salesforce settings side and on the BZ environment.
	String magic_token;

  /// The Phone number that outoing Twilio text messages come from.
  /// This number is what we have our Twilio account configured to use.
  /// We must own it.
  String BZ_Twilio_From_Phone__c;

  /// The Acount SID used to connect to our Twilio account using the
  /// API
  String BZ_Twilio_Account__c;

  /// The token used to connection to our Twilio account using the API
  String BZ_Twilio_Token__c;
}
